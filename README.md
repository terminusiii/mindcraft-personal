> [!Caution]
Do not connect this bot to public servers with coding enabled. This project allows an LLM to write/execute code on your computer. The code is sandboxed, but still vulnerable to injection attacks. Code writing is disabled by default, you can enable it by setting `allow_insecure_coding` to `true` in `settings.js`. Ye be warned.

# Getting Started
## Requirements

- [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc) (up to v1.21.11, recommend v1.21.6)
- [Node.js Installed](https://nodejs.org/) (Node v18 or v20 LTS recommended. Node v24+ may cause issues with native dependencies)
- At least one API key from a supported API provider. See [supported APIs](#model-customization). OpenAI is the default.

> [!Important]
> If installing node on windows, ensure you check `Automatically install the necessary tools`
>
> If you encounter `npm install` errors on macOS, see the [FAQ](FAQ.md#common-issues) for troubleshooting native module build issues

## Install and Run

1. Make sure you have the requirements above.

2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft/releases/latest) and unzip it, or clone the repository.

3. Rename `keys.example.json` to `keys.json` and fill in your API keys (you only need one). The desired model is set in `andy.json` or other profiles. For other models refer to the table below.

4. In terminal/command prompt, run `npm install` from the installed directory

5. Start a minecraft world and open it to LAN on localhost port `55916`
```bash
(base) melinda2@Peter4Ever:~/minecraft-server$ ./start_server.sh
```

6. Run `node main.js` from the installed directory

### Entering a Nether portal

When you intentionally want the bot to travel to the Nether, send `!enterNether`
in chat (or explicitly ask the bot to enter the Nether). This risky action is
human-requested, not an autonomous travel goal. `!searchForBlock("nether_portal", 64)`
only approaches a portal; it deliberately stops several blocks away.

`!enterNether` searches active portal blocks within 64 loaded blocks, selects a
reachable bottom entry with solid support and portal headroom, and walks into
that block without digging or building. It allows up to 30 seconds to reach the
portal and then up to 15 seconds for transfer. Success requires the bot's dimension
to become the Nether, not merely reaching a portal block. Missing or unreachable
portals and timeouts are reported; if already in the Nether, it does not travel
back. Send `!stop` to interrupt. Safety modes can still interrupt dangerous travel.

To return, send `!enterOverworld` while the bot is in the Nether. It uses the same
portal search, entry selection, no-dig/no-build movement, time limits and `!stop`
handling, and reports success only after the dimension becomes the Overworld. It
refuses to run outside the Nether. Both commands are human-requested only.

For a local WSL2 smoke test, start your usual local Minecraft server and Mindcraft
(`nvm use 20.20.2`, then `node main.js`). Use a copy of your test world and an active
portal with a clear approach. From the Overworld, send `!enterNether` and confirm
the bot stands inside the purple portal and reports success only after transfer.
Repeat in the Nether to check the no-travel response. Then, next to the Nether-side
portal, send `!enterOverworld` and confirm success only after arriving back; sending
it again in the Overworld should refuse to travel. In the Overworld, also try
without a nearby portal, with all entries obstructed, and `!stop` during approach
or the transfer wait. On a local server with Nether travel disabled, verify the
bounded failure instead of a false success.

Run the isolated portal regression tests with
`node --experimental-vm-modules --test tests/enter-nether.test.js`.
They use mocked Mineflayer APIs and do not require a running server or installed
game dependencies; the local smoke test is still needed to verify real movement.

### Viewing the bot in a web browser

Mindcraft includes a Prismarine Viewer that shows the Minecraft world from the bot's first-person perspective.

1. Set `"render_bot_view": true` in [settings.js](settings.js).
2. Start or restart Mindcraft and wait for the bot to join the Minecraft server and spawn.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Additional bots use ports `3001`, `3002`, and so on.

The viewer is also embedded in the Mindcraft dashboard at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) when using the default dashboard port. You do not need to enable `allow_vision` to use the browser viewer.

If Mindcraft runs on a remote machine through VS Code, forward port `3000` in the **Ports** panel and open its forwarded address. Forward `8080` too if you want the dashboard, and forward the viewer ports for any additional bots. Keep forwarded ports private; the dashboard expects each viewer at `localhost` on its original port.

If the viewer reports "connection refused", check that `render_bot_view` is enabled, restart Mindcraft after changing it, and confirm the bot has spawned. For Docker, the viewer port must also be published; the provided Compose setup publishes ports `3000` through `3003`.

### Debugging in VS Code

The **Start Mindcraft bot** launch configuration selects Node.js **20.20.2** through nvm instead of the system Node executable. Install it with `nvm install 20.20.2` if needed, then start debugging with **F5**. For terminal runs, use `nvm use 20.20.2` before `node main.js`.

An `Unexpected token '.'` error on optional chaining (`?.`) indicates an outdated Node runtime. Check `node --version`; the system `/usr/bin/node` may differ from the version installed through nvm.

If you encounter issues, check the [FAQ](https://github.com/mindcraft-bots/mindcraft/blob/main/FAQ.md) or find support on [discord](https://discord.gg/mp73p35dzC). We are currently not very responsive to github issues. To run tasks please refer to [Minecollab Instructions](minecollab.md#installation)


# Configuration
## Model Customization

You can configure project details in `settings.js`. [See file.](settings.js)

You can configure the agent's name, model, and prompts in their profile like `andy.json`. The model can be specified with the `model` field, with values like `model: "gemini-2.5-pro"`. You will need the correct API key for the API provider you choose. See all supported APIs below.

For more comprehensive model configuration and syntax, see [Model Specifications](#model-specifications).

For local models we support [ollama](https://ollama.com/) and we provide our own finetuned models for you to use. 
To install our models, install ollama and run the following terminal command:
```bash
ollama pull sweaterdog/andy-4:micro-q8_0 && ollama pull embeddinggemma
```

## Online Servers
To connect to online servers your bot will need an official Microsoft/Minecraft account. You can use your own personal one, but will need another account if you want to connect too and play with it. To connect, change these lines in `settings.js`:
```javascript
"host": "111.222.333.444",
"port": 55920,
"auth": "microsoft",

// rest is same...
```
> [!Important]
> The bot's name in the profile.json must exactly match the Minecraft profile name! Otherwise the bot will spam talk to itself.

To use different accounts, Mindcraft will connect with the account that the Minecraft launcher is currently using. You can switch accounts in the launcher, then run `node main.js`, then switch to your main account after the bot has connected.

## Tasks

Tasks automatically start the bot with a prompt and a goal item to acquire or blueprint to construct. To run a simple task that involves collecting 4 oak_logs run 

`node main.js --task_path tasks/basic/single_agent.json --task_id gather_oak_logs`

Here is an example task json format: 

```
{
    "gather_oak_logs": {
      "goal": "Collect at least four logs",
      "initial_inventory": {
        "0": {
          "wooden_axe": 1
        }
      },
      "agent_count": 1,
      "target": "oak_log",
      "number_of_target": 4,
      "type": "techtree",
      "max_depth": 1,
      "depth": 0,
      "timeout": 300,
      "blocked_actions": {
        "0": [],
        "1": []
      },
      "missing_items": [],
      "requires_ctable": false
    }
}
```

The `initial_inventory` is what the bot will have at the start of the episode, `target` refers to the target item and `number_of_target` refers to the number of target items the agent needs to collect to successfully complete the task. 

If you want more optimization and automatic launching of the minecraft world, you will need to follow the instructions in [Minecollab Instructions](minecollab.md#installation)

## Docker Container

If you intend to `allow_insecure_coding`, it is a good idea to run the app in a docker container to reduce risks of running unknown code. This is strongly recommended before connecting to remote servers, although still does not guarantee complete safety.

```bash
docker build -t mindcraft . && docker run --rm --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -p 8080:8080 -p 3000-3003:3000-3003 -e SETTINGS_JSON='{"auto_open_ui":false,"profiles":["./profiles/gemini.json"],"host":"host.docker.internal"}' --volume ./keys.json:/app/keys.json --name mindcraft mindcraft
```
or simply
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The Compose setup starts a Minecraft Java server alongside Mindcraft. It uses the `itzg/minecraft-server` image and the settings shown above, waits for the server to become healthy before starting Mindcraft, and stores world data in `minecraft-data/`. Stop any separately running server first to avoid a port conflict. To reuse an existing world, set `MINECRAFT_DATA_DIR` to that server's `data` directory; for example: `MINECRAFT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/minecraft-server/data docker compose up --build`. The server is available on `127.0.0.1:25565` from the host. To stop both services, run `docker compose down`; the world data is retained.

> [!Note]
> The Minecraft server container requires EULA acceptance. If it gets stuck restarting, set EULA in the mounted data directory and recreate the container:
> ```bash
> mkdir -p minecraft-data
> echo 'eula=true' > minecraft-data/eula.txt
> docker compose up -d --force-recreate minecraft
> ```

To create a named world backup snapshot from the current game state, run:

```bash
./tasks/save_world_backup.sh save <backup-name>
```

Example:

```bash
./tasks/save_world_backup.sh save ender-dragon-before-fight
```

The script stores backups in `minecraft_backups/`, and if the Minecraft container is running it flushes world state with `save-all` before archiving.

To restore a named backup, run:

```bash
./tasks/save_world_backup.sh restore <backup-name>
```

When running Mindcraft in Docker to connect to a Minecraft server on the host instead, use the special host address `host.docker.internal` to reach the host from inside the container. Set `"host": "host.docker.internal"` in your [settings.js](settings.js), or set it in `SETTINGS_JSON` when using Docker Compose:

```javascript
"host": "host.docker.internal", // instead of "localhost", to join your local minecraft from inside the docker container
```

To connect to an unsupported minecraft version, you can try to use [viaproxy](services/viaproxy/README.md)

# Bot Profiles

Bot profiles are json files (such as `andy.json`) that define:

1. Bot backend LLMs to use for talking, coding, and embedding.
2. Prompts used to influence the bot's behavior.
3. Examples help the bot perform tasks.

## Model Specifications

LLM models can be specified simply as `"model": "gpt-5.4"`, or more specifically with `"{api}/{model}"`, like `"openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-pro"`. See all supported APIs [here](#model-customization).

The `model` field can be a string or an object. A model object must specify an `api`, and optionally a `model`, `url`, and additional `params`. You can also use different models/providers for chatting, coding, vision, embedding, and voice synthesis. See the example below.

```json
"model": {
  "api": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/",
  "params": {
    "max_tokens": 1000,
    "temperature": 1
  }
},
"code_model": {
  "api": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-5.4-mini",
  "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/"
},
"vision_model": {
  "api": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/"
},
"embedding": {
  "api": "openai",
  "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/",
  "model": "text-embedding-3-small"
},
"speak_model": "openai/tts-1/echo"
```

`model` is used for chat, `code_model` is used for newAction coding, `vision_model` is used for image interpretation, `embedding` is used to embed text for example selection, and `speak_model` is used for voice synthesis. `model` will be used by default for all other models if not specified. Not all APIs support embeddings, vision, or voice synthesis.

All apis have default models and urls, so those fields are optional. The `params` field is optional and can be used to specify additional parameters for the model. It accepts any key-value pairs supported by the api. Is not supported for embedding models.

## Embedding Models

Embedding models are used to embed and efficiently select relevant examples for conversation and coding.

Supported Embedding APIs: `openai`, `google`, `replicate`, `huggingface`, `novita`

If you try to use an unsupported model, then it will default to a simple word-overlap method. Expect reduced performance. We recommend using supported embedding APIs.

## Voice Synthesis Models

Voice synthesis models are used to narrate bot responses and specified with `speak_model`. This field is parsed differently than other models and only supports strings formatted as `"{api}/{model}/{voice}"`, like `"openai/tts-1/echo"`. We only support `openai` and `google` for voice synthesis.

## Specifying Profiles via Command Line

By default, the program will use the profiles specified in `settings.js`. You can specify one or more agent profiles using the `--profiles` argument: `node main.js --profiles ./profiles/andy.json ./profiles/jill.json`
